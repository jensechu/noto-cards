# ノート Cards


## Summary
#### [Live Version](http://jensechu.github.com/noto-cards)
This web app serves to help me learn Japanese! It loads a random Japanese sentence every five minutes with the goal of subtle eposure/challenge throughout my day. It works on mobile! :iphone:

The user can toggle the English translation by clicking on the Japanese sentence. Also the five minute timer can be paused by clicking on the 'Stop' button, and manually changed by clicking the 'Heart' icon.

The notification (favicon) will update to a dark pink when the user is not focued on the page and a new sentences pops up.
