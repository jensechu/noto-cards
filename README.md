# ノート Cards


## Summary
A tiny web app for helping me learn Japanese. It displays sentences in Japanese from a json file, and toggles the English translation on click. It will randomly display a card after five minutes.

## Help Me Learn
Please! Submit a pull request to add sentences to my json file! :relaxed:
